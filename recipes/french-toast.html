    <h1>French Toast</h1>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p> a dish of sliced bread soaked in beaten eggs and often milk or cream, then pan fried</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons honey, warmed in microwave for 20 seconds</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>8 (1/2-inch) slices day-old or stale country loaf, brioche or challah bread</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>In medium size mixing bowl, whisk together the half-and-half, eggs, honey, and salt. You may do this the night before. When ready to cook, pour custard mixture into a pie pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Dip bread into mixture, allow to soak for 30 seconds on each side, and then remove to a cooling rack that is sitting in a sheet pan, and allow to sit for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Over medium-low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a 10-inch nonstick saute pan. Place 2 slices of bread at a time into the pan and cook until golden brown, approximately 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan and place on rack in oven for 5 minutes. Repeat with all 8 slices. Serve immediately with maple syrup, whipped cream or fruit.</li>
      </ol>
